# Company Purchases Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Company Purchases functionality implemented for the Incubator OS application. The implementation follows the same architectural patterns as the existing `CompanyFinancials` feature, providing a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing company purchase records.

## Database Schema

### Table: `company_purchases`
```sql
CREATE TABLE `company_purchases` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `company_id` int NOT NULL,
  `purchase_type` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL,
  `service_provider` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `items` text,
  `amount` decimal(14,2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `purchase_order` tinyint(1) DEFAULT '0',
  `invoice_received` tinyint(1) DEFAULT '0',
  `invoice_type` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL,
  `items_received` tinyint(1) DEFAULT '0',
  `aligned_with_presentation` tinyint(1) DEFAULT '0',
  `source_file` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `created_at` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `updated_at` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `idx_cp_company` (`company_id`),
  KEY `idx_cp_service_provider` (`service_provider`),
  KEY `idx_cp_purchase_type` (`purchase_type`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_cp_company` FOREIGN KEY (`company_id`) REFERENCES `companies` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

### Key Features:
- **Foreign Key Relationship**: Links to `companies` table with CASCADE delete
- **Decimal Precision**: `amount` field uses `decimal(14,2)` for precise financial calculations
- **Boolean Tracking**: Multiple boolean fields for tracking purchase workflow status
- **Automatic Timestamps**: `created_at` and `updated_at` with automatic management
- **Indexed Fields**: Optimized queries on `company_id`, `service_provider`, and `purchase_type`
