# 🔧 Chart Rendering Fix - Technical Details

## Issue Fixed
The financial comparison charts were not displaying on initial page load and only appeared after clicking the toggle button.

## Root Cause
1. **Canvas ID Conflicts**: Both line and bar chart components used hardcoded canvas IDs (`line-chart`, `bar-chart`)
2. **DOM Timing Issues**: Chart.js initialization was happening before DOM elements were fully rendered
3. **Initialization Race Conditions**: Multiple chart instances competing for same canvas elements

## Solution Implemented

### 🎯 **Unique Canvas IDs**
```typescript
// Generate unique chart ID for each instance
chartId = `line-chart-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
```

### ⏰ **Proper Timing**
```typescript
ngOnInit(): void {
  // Wait for DOM to be ready
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.initializeChart();
  }, 0);
}
```

### 🔄 **Enhanced Chart Lifecycle**
```typescript
ngOnDestroy(): void {
  if (this.chart) {
    this.chart.destroy(); // Prevent memory leaks
  }
}
```

### 📊 **Better Chart Options**
- Added responsive behavior
- Improved grid styling
- Enhanced tooltip configuration
- Better legend positioning

## Benefits of the Fix

✅ **Immediate Chart Display**: Charts now render correctly on first load  
✅ **No More Canvas Conflicts**: Each chart gets a unique canvas element  
✅ **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup on component destruction  
✅ **Better Error Handling**: Graceful failure with console logging  
✅ **Enhanced Visual Quality**: Improved chart styling and responsiveness  

## Technical Improvements

### Chart Components Enhanced
- `LineChartComponent`: Now with unique IDs and proper lifecycle
- `BarChartComponent`: Enhanced initialization and cleanup
- `FinancialYearComparisonComponent`: Better loading states and timing

### Performance Optimizations
- Non-blocking chart generation
- Proper DOM ready checks
- Resource cleanup on component destruction
- Optimized re-rendering on chart type switches

## Testing Confirmed
✅ Charts display immediately on page load  
✅ Smooth switching between line and bar charts  
✅ No console errors or warnings  
✅ Proper cleanup when navigating away  
✅ Responsive behavior maintained
