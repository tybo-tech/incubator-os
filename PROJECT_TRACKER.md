## 🚨 **BLOCKERS & RISKS**

### **Current Blockers**
- [ ] None identified ✅

- [ ] **Integration Complexity**: Complex forms may require additional testing
- [ ] **Performance**: High-volume form submissions need optimization

---

## 📝 **NOTES & DECISIONS**

### **Technical Decisions Made**
- ✅ **Form Scope System**: Use scope_type + scope_id for program association
- ✅ **Session Management**: Link sessions to categories_item_id for enrollment context
- ✅ **Status Workflow**: 5-stage approval process (draft → submitted → verified → approved → cancelled)
- ✅ **Data Architecture**: Separate form structure (nodes) from session data (responses)

### **Pending Decisions**
- [ ] **Form Template Strategy**: How to handle common form patterns
- [ ] **Versioning Approach**: How to manage form structure changes
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: What data to cache and for how long
- [ ] **Backup Plan**: Rollback strategy if migration issues occur
