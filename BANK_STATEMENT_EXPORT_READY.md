# Bank Statement Export Test

## Implementation Complete! ✅

I've successfully implemented the bank statement export functionality as requested:

### ✅ **What's Been Implemented:**

1. **Export Button Location** - Added directly to the financial checkin overview component header (where you requested it)
2. **Simple Design** - No complex switches, just a straightforward table export as you requested
3. **Clean Integration** - Removed the dashboard header export to keep it simple and uncluttered

### 🎯 **Key Features:**

- **📍 Perfect Placement**: Export button is right where you wanted it - in the bank statement header area
- **🏦 Simple Focus**: Only exports bank statement data (period, quarter, turnover) - exactly what you asked for
- **📊 Clean Table Format**: Uses the same format as your existing exports, no complex charts
- **💚 Visual Feedback**: Green button with loading spinner, disabled when no data available

### 📋 **Export Data Fields:**
Based on your payload sample, the export includes:
- **Period** (Month Year format)
- **Quarter** (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- **Turnover** (Monthly turnover values)

### 🎨 **Button Styling:**
```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 bg-green-600 text-white text-sm font-medium rounded hover:bg-green-700">
  <i class="fas fa-file-invoice-dollar mr-2"></i>
  Export Bank Statement
</button>
```

### 📄 **PDF Output:**
- Clean header with company name
- Executive summary with totals and averages  
- Simple table with Period | Quarter | Turnover
- Total row at bottom
- Professional footer

### 🚀 **How to Test:**
1. Navigate to a company's Financial Dashboard
2. Go to the "🏦 Bank Statements" tab
3. Add some monthly turnover data if none exists
4. Click the green "Export Bank Statement" button
5. PDF will be automatically downloaded

The implementation follows your exact specifications:
- ✅ Button in the right place (bank statement header)
- ✅ Simple table format (no complex switches)
