Weâ€™ll keep it flexible so each metric type can define how it should be tracked (quarterly vs yearly). Later we can add half-yearly if needed.

ðŸŸ¢ Step 1: Alter metric_types

Letâ€™s add a period_type column that defines whether the metric is QUARTERLY or YEARLY.

ALTER TABLE metric_types
ADD COLUMN period_type ENUM('QUARTERLY','YEARLY') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'QUARTERLY';


QUARTERLY â†’ uses Q1â€“Q4 + totals (Revenue, Profit, Employees, etc.)

YEARLY â†’ uses only total (Direct Costs, Operational Costs, Balance Sheet, etc.)

ðŸŸ¢ Step 2: Insert the New Groups

We already have Revenue, Profits, and Employees.
Letâ€™s add some more top-level groups to mirror the tabs in your screenshot:

INSERT INTO metric_groups (client_id, code, name, description, show_total, show_margin, graph_color, order_no)
VALUES
(1, 'COST_STRUCTURE', 'Cost Structure', 'Tracks company costs such as direct costs and operational costs.', 1, 0, '#9467bd', 3),
(1, 'BALANCE_SHEET', 'Balance Sheet', 'Tracks company assets, liabilities, and equity.', 1, 0, '#8c564b', 4),
(1, 'RATIOS', 'Ratios', 'Financial ratios such as current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-equity, etc.', 1, 0, '#e377c2', 5),
(1, 'FUNDS_RECEIVED', 'Funds Received', 'Grants, investments, and other funds received by the company.', 1, 0, '#7f7f7f', 6);

ðŸŸ¢ Step 3: Insert Metric Types for Cost Structure

Weâ€™ll use YEARLY here since costs are often tracked as annual totals:

INSERT INTO metric_types (group_id, code, name, description, unit, show_total, show_margin, graph_color, period_type)
VALUES
((SELECT id FROM metric_groups WHERE code = 'COST_STRUCTURE'), 'DIRECT_COSTS', 'Direct Costs', 'Cost of goods/services sold (COGS).', 'ZAR', 1, 0, '#bcbd22', 'YEARLY'),
((SELECT id FROM metric_groups WHERE code = 'COST_STRUCTURE'), 'OPERATING_COSTS', 'Operational Costs', 'Overhead and operating expenses.', 'ZAR', 1, 0, '#17becf', 'YEARLY');

ðŸŸ¢ Step 4: Example Records (Company 11, Program 2, Cohort 3)
-- Direct Costs (Yearly)
INSERT INTO metric_records 
(client_id, company_id, program_id, cohort_id, metric_type_id, year_, total, unit)
VALUES
(1, 11, 2, 3, (SELECT id FROM metric_types WHERE code='DIRECT_COSTS'), 2024, 28000, 'ZAR'),
(1, 11, 2, 3, (SELECT id FROM metric_types WHERE code='DIRECT_COSTS'), 2025, 31000, 'ZAR');

-- Operational Costs (Yearly)
INSERT INTO metric_records 
(client_id, company_id, program_id, cohort_id, metric_type_id, year_, total, unit)
VALUES
(1, 11, 2, 3, (SELECT id FROM metric_types WHERE code='OPERATING_COSTS'), 2024, 25600, 'ZAR'),
(1, 11, 2, 3, (SELECT id FROM metric_types WHERE code='OPERATING_COSTS'), 2025, 27000, 'ZAR');

ðŸŸ¢ Summary

Now your metrics engine supports:

Quarterly tracking â†’ Revenue, Profits, Employees (with Q1â€“Q4).

Yearly tracking â†’ Cost Structure, Balance Sheet, Ratios, Funds Received.

And the UI can simply check period_type in metric_types to know whether to render:

Quarterly grid (Q1â€“Q4 + total)

Yearly input (just total)
